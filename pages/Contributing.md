# Contributing

As a relatively new project, Frequency is moving quickly to get our open-source technologies to market.
However, the power and utility of the project going forward will depend on robust and continual contributions from the development community.
Contributions are welcomed, and those interested in contributing to Frequency should begin by connecting with our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/frequency-chain/frequency/).

All contributions and contributors are guided by the [Project Liberty Code of Conduct](https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/meta/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), designed to ensure an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, equitable and healthy community.
