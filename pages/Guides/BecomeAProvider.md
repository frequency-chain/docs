# Become a Provider

## What is a Provider?

In the Frequency ecosystem, a **Provider** is an entity (often an application or service) that interacts directly with the Frequency blockchain on behalf of users.
Providers handle transactions, manage user delegations, and facilitate various operations within the network.

### From a developer's perspective, Providers:

* **Create and Update User Content with Permission:** Providers publish new content or modify existing content on behalf of users, such as posts, comments, and other social interactions, after obtaining the user's consent.
* **Maintain the User's Social Graph:** Providers manage and update users' social connections, such as following or unfollowing other users, and maintaining friend lists, ensuring that the user's relationships are accurately represented on the blockchain.
* **Store User Content and Write Links to It on Frequency:** Providers either store user-generated content files (e.g., media files, documents) or links to off-chain storage of these content files on the Frequency blockchain, enabling decentralized access and verification.
* **Simplify User Participation:** By handling transaction complexities and fees, Providers make blockchain applications more accessible to end-users who may not possess sufficient technical knowledge or hold tokens.
* **Manage Delegated Tasks:** Users delegate specific permissions to Providers, allowing them to perform only those specified actions on the user's behalf in a secure and transparent manner.
* **Enhance User Experience:** Providers may offer intuitive user interfaces and seamless interactions, so users don't need to experience or understand the underlying blockchain mechanics.
